about: Hi, Yao Yuheng from China. Currently I'm a master student of data science in NTU.
       I'm interested in design pipeline to solve data related problems,
       e.g. recently I profiled and cleaned a food inspection file by fuzzy matching and approximate function dependency. 
       I also mined the association rules based on Apriori algorthm and managen the data into a database.
       Another project I've done recently is to analyze the collaboration network of NTU CCDS faculty with open data in DBLP.
       Before I learn data science, I was a collage student marjor in Statists in BUAA, so I'm also interested and mastered in Statists and ML.
